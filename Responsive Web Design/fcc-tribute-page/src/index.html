    <p id="tribute-info"><b>Lapulapu</b> or <b>Lapu-lapu</b> was a datu of Mactan in Visayas. Modern Philippine society regards him as <i>the first Filipino hero</i>
because he was the first native to resist imperial Spanish colonization. He is best known for the <i>Battle of Mactan</i> that happened 
      at dawn on April 27, 1521, where he and his warriors defeated Portuguese explorer <i>Ferdinand Magellan</i>, who was killed in battle.
Magellan's death ended his voyage of circumnavigation and delayed the Spanish occupation of the islands by over forty years until 
      the expedition of <i>Miguel LÃ³pez de Legazpi</i> in 1564. Monuments of Lapulapu have been built in Cebu and Manila, while the <i>Philippine Nation
      Police</i> and the <i>Bureau of Fire Protection</i> use his image as part of their official seals. </p>
